# stylus.vim
Syntax hightlighting for [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/).

## Manual Installation
Unzip tar into your `.vim` directory

## Pathogen Installation
Clone this git repo in your `bundle` directory.

## Todo
This is by no means complete.  Please help if you'd like, I'm taking patches :)  The following is left to be done:
* Syntax highlighting for controls and types.
* Syntax hightlighting for user defined functions
* Better indentation support

## Creds
This is based on the excellent work from Tim Pope on sass.vim.
